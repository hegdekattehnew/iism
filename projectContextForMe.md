# Project context — read this first

Working notes for Claude Code. Purpose: recover full context on a new session without
re-reading the codebase or the conversation history. Update it at the end of any session
that changes the shape of the project.

## 1. What this is

**IISM — Intelligent Integrated Skill Marketplace.** A marketplace connecting candidates,
vocational courses and vocational jobs, where all three are decomposed into NSQF-aligned
skills so the system can compute what a person is missing for the work they want, and which
training closes that gap.

The core loop is the product: **candidate → target job → skill gap → courses that close it → job.**
The listings are commodity; the skill graph and the scoring over it are the defensible part.

India-first, multi-sector, Hindi + English at launch, free in v1.

## 2. Where the real documentation lives

| Document | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `docs/adr/architecture-decisions.md` | **33 ADRs — the source of truth for every design decision.** Read before any structural change. |
| `docs/IISM-Product-Definition.docx` | 20-page product definition: problem, actors, intelligence layer, scope, risks, decision appendix. Written for the founding team, deliberately candid. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Working conventions, repo layout, current state. Auto-loaded each session. |
| `README.md` | Setup and run instructions. |
| `~/.claude/plans/i-want-to-create-lively-phoenix.md` | **The sprint plan, 1–4.** Sprints 1–2 as built; 3–4 planned in detail with deliverables, on-screen outcome, exclusions, definition of done and verification. Lives outside the repo. |
| This file | Session-to-session continuity, environment quirks, hard-won gotchas. |

ADR-001–023 came from a March 2026 spreadsheet. **ADR-024–033 were written in this project
(Sept 2026)** and cover: multi-sector scope, monetization deferral, supply acquisition, ARQ over
Celery, AWS topology, Next.js client, in-house identity, AI provider abstraction, dual credentials,
language scope. Three repairs were also made: ADR-014's malformed status, ADR-015 marked superseded,
and **ADR-023's `Final decision` field was empty** — the most compliance-sensitive decision in the
document was formally unresolved. It is now filled in.

## 3. Decisions that were genuinely contested

Do not silently re-litigate these; they were deliberate and are recorded in ADRs.

- **Multi-sector, not single-sector.** Overrides ADR-015. Taxonomy is sector-agnostic, so
  constraining it saved little. Trade: go-to-market focus. If validation stalls, narrow the GTM
  while keeping the taxonomy general.
- **Free v1, no revenue model.** ADR-025 *defers* the question rather than answering it.
  Measurement replaces revenue as the signal — precision@5 on a golden set, click-through,
  enrollment conversion. None of that instrumentation exists yet.
- **Deterministic decides; the LLM only explains.** ADR-005/018. A product principle, not a
  technical footnote. No LLM ever produces a match score.
- **Embeddings pinned at 384 dimensions.** ADR-031. pgvector's HNSW needs a fixed dimension;
  384 is the only size natively shared by MiniLM and reachable by OpenAI/Gemini Matryoshka
  reduction. Any other number silently breaks the multi-provider adapter.
- **Phone + OTP for candidates, email for organisations.** ADR-032. Makes SMS a login-availability
  concern, not a notification nicety.
- **ARQ, not Celery.** ADR-027 amends ADR-006. The app is async end to end.

Decided while planning Sprints 3 and 4 (not yet ADRs — write them if they survive contact):

- **Inventory before authentication.** An earlier note said auth was Sprint 3; that was revised
  because there is still nothing worth protecting. A login form proves nothing about whether the
  product works. Jobs and courses land first, then a profile worth protecting.
- **Jobs and courses anchor to skills only.** No Qualification Pack or Occupation hierarchy yet —
  matching works from skill overlap alone, and QP anchoring becomes a nullable column later rather
  than a restructure. Keeps NSQF sourcing off the critical path.
- **`Tenant` arrives in Sprint 3, before auth.** Jobs and courses must belong to something; a
  throwaway `organisation_name` string would force an FK migration later. One small table now,
  models only, `User` and `Membership` layered on in Sprint 4.

## 4. Current state

**Sprint 1 (walking skeleton) — complete.** Every architectural layer exists and is connected,
with near-zero business logic.

**Sprint 2 (skill taxonomy) — complete.** `Skill` + `SkillAlias`, 52 bilingual skills, 149 aliases,
multi-script search, `/skills` browser and `/skills/[slug]` detail in both locales.

**Sprint 3 (marketplace) — complete.** `Tenant` (identity, models only), `Job` + `JobSkill`,
`Course` + `CourseSkill`. 8 tenants, 20 jobs, 20 courses, 96 job-skill and 76 course-skill links,
all bilingual. `/jobs` and `/courses` browsers with filters and detail pages; `/skills/[slug]`
shows jobs needing the skill and courses teaching it. 46 tests.

**Also built (unplanned addition):** the public homepage template — header with nav and CTAs, hero
with search, how-it-works, audience cards, browse panels, CTA band, footer. The Sprint 1 System
Status panel now lives at the *foot of the homepage* behind a "Development panel" badge.

**Sprint 4 (identity + profile) — complete.** `User` (nullable independently-unique phone/email),
`Membership`, personal tenants provisioned at first sign-in. Phone + OTP, hashed codes in Redis,
per-phone rate limiting, 5-guess cap, JWT access + rotating refresh. `NotificationProvider`
adapter with a console implementation. `CandidateProfile` + `CandidateSkill` carrying `source`.
`/signin` and `/profile` live; header reflects auth state. 78 tests.

**Verified at last run:** 78 Python tests pass · Ruff + mypy clean · tsc + ESLint clean ·
routes all correct · migrations round-trip properly (verified by exit code and table counts,
not by log-grepping) · 52 skills / 149 aliases / 8 tenants / 20 jobs / 20 courses.

**Not built yet:** authentication and candidate profiles (Sprint 4), matching (Sprint 5), the NSQF
hierarchy above Skill (SSC → Sector → Occupation → QP → NOS), typed `SkillRelation` edges,
embeddings, analytics instrumentation, observability, encryption path.

## 5. Repository map

```
api/                    FastAPI modular monolith
  main.py               app, health, demo task endpoints
  core/                 config, database, cache, tasks (ARQ), health
  modules/skills/       models, schemas, service, routes, __init__ (public interface)
  modules/marketplace/  Job, JobSkill, Course, CourseSkill + browse/detail endpoints
  modules/identity/     User, Tenant, Membership, OTP sign-in, JWT
  core/security.py      tokens, OTP hashing, rate limits, get_current_user
  adapters/notifications/  NotificationProvider protocol + console impl
web/                    Next.js 16 PWA
  src/app/[locale]/     13 routes, all bilingual
  src/components/       Header, Hero, HowItWorks, Audiences, BrowsePanels, CtaBand,
                        Footer, SkillBrowser, SystemStatus, DevPanel, PlaceholderPage, ui
  src/messages/         en.json, hi.json — no user-facing string is hardcoded
  src/lib/api-schema.d.ts  GENERATED from OpenAPI, never hand-edit
infra/docker-compose.yml   Postgres 16 + pgvector, Redis 7
migrations/versions/    0001 (pgvector + skills), 0002 (taxonomy + search),
                        0003 (tenants, jobs, courses),
                        0004 (users, memberships, candidate profiles)
scripts/                seed_skills.py, seed_marketplace.py — both idempotent
tests/                  pytest + testcontainers
```

`api/modules/skills/` is the **reference implementation** of the module pattern. Copy its shape
for every new module: own models/schemas/service/routes, narrow public interface in `__init__.py`,
and other modules import only from `api.modules.<name>`.

## 6. The local machine — quirks that will waste time

This is an **Apple Silicon (arm64) Mac, macOS 26.6.2**, and the setup has traps:

- **Default `node` is v8.16.2** via nvm. The nvm default was repointed to **v24.18.0**, but a
  non-login Bash shell may still resolve v8. When node fails with weird syntax errors, use the
  explicit path: `~/.nvm/versions/node/v24.18.0/bin`.
- **System `python3` is 3.7.1.** The project uses **uv-managed Python 3.12.14** in `.venv`.
  Always invoke `.venv/bin/python`, never bare `python3`.
- **Homebrew at `/usr/local` is the Intel build running under Rosetta.** Everything it installs is
  x86_64. Deliberately left alone — Python comes from uv (native arm64) instead. Do not install
  project dependencies through brew.
- **Docker host ports are non-default:** Postgres **5433**, Redis **6380**, chosen so any
  pre-existing local install is untouched. Docker Desktop is native aarch64, 8 GB / 8 CPU —
  raise the memory before embedding workers arrive.
- **Docker CLI was not on PATH.** `~/.docker/bin` and `~/.local/bin` were added to `.zshrc`
  (backup at `~/.zshrc.bak-20260901-141223`).
- LibreOffice, pandoc and poppler are **not installed**, so .docx → PDF rendering is unavailable
  locally. `textutil` and `qlmanage` are the macOS-native fallbacks.

## 7. Commands

```bash
make up          # start Postgres + Redis, wait for healthy
make migrate     # alembic upgrade head
make seed        # load the skill taxonomy (idempotent)
make api         # uvicorn on :8000
make worker      # ARQ worker
make web         # Next.js on :3000
make check       # ruff + mypy + pytest  <- run before claiming anything works
make gen-api     # regenerate the TS client after ANY endpoint change
```

Three processes must run for the full stack: **api, worker, web.**

## 8. Gotchas — each of these cost real time

1. **Never bind config at import time.** `from api.core.config import settings` captures the object
   before tests can override it, and silently points the engine at the *development* database.
   Always `get_settings()` inside functions. There is no module-level `settings` singleton.
2. **`Skill.search_vector` is `GENERATED ALWAYS` in Postgres.** It must be declared with SQLAlchemy
   `Computed(..., persisted=True)`, otherwise the ORM includes it in INSERT and Postgres rejects
   the write.
3. **pytest event loops must be session-scoped for both fixtures and tests.**
   `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` *and* `asyncio_default_test_loop_scope` are both set to
   `session`; asyncpg connections cannot cross event loops.
4. **`migrations/env.py` must not clobber a pre-set `sqlalchemy.url`.** The test suite sets it to a
   container; env.py only falls back to environment config when it is absent.
5. **Route order matters:** `/skills/search` is declared *before* `/skills/{slug}`, or the literal
   path gets captured as a slug. There is a test guarding this.
6. **TanStack Query pauses `refetchInterval` on hidden tabs.** Status boards and job polling need
   `refetchIntervalInBackground: true` — without it the demo task appears to hang forever.
7. **React 19 lints `setState` inside `useEffect` as an error.** Use TanStack Query for server
   state, and derive values rather than storing and syncing them.
8. **Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`.** Also, `next dev` regenerates
   `web/CLAUDE.md` and `web/AGENTS.md` on every run — commit them, don't fight them.
9. **Postgres ships no Hindi text-search configuration.** Hindi uses the `simple` config plus
   `pg_trgm`. This partially undercuts ADR-021 and may pull the OpenSearch migration forward.
10. **The preview browser pane returns blank screenshots when scrolled while hidden.** Verify
    below-the-fold content by DOM inspection (`javascript_tool` / `get_page_text`), not screenshots.
11. **Never trust an autogenerated migration.** Raw-SQL indexes (GIN/trigram/tsvector) are invisible
    to SQLAlchemy metadata, so `--autogenerate` proposes DROPping them — which would silently break
    search. `migrations/env.py` now has an `include_object` guard with a
    `MANUALLY_MANAGED_INDEXES` set; add to it whenever you create an index via `op.execute()`.
    Autogenerate also writes the mirror-image `create_index` into `downgrade()`, which fails with
    DuplicateTableError — delete those too.
12. **Verify migrations by exit code and table counts, not by grepping log output.** A failed
    downgrade rolls back and leaves the version row untouched, so a naive `grep 'Running downgrade'`
    reports success on a migration that actually errored. This bit us once already.
13. **`include_object` must be passed in BOTH `run_migrations_offline` and `do_run_migrations`.**
    Autogenerate uses the online path; patching only the offline one silently does nothing.
14. **Alembic does not diff CHECK constraint bodies.** Widening `tenant_type` to allow `personal`
    was invisible to autogenerate; without a hand-written `drop_constraint`/`create_check_constraint`
    every candidate sign-in would have failed on insert.
15. **`db.refresh()` does not cascade nested eager loads,** and a plain re-query returns the stale
    instance from the identity map. Mutating a relationship then serialising it needs
    `selectinload(...).selectinload(...)` **plus** `.execution_options(populate_existing=True)`.
    Without the latter the query succeeds and returns the wrong data — no error at all.
16. **Application-written timestamps need `DateTime(timezone=True)`.** A bare `Mapped[datetime]`
    maps to `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` and asyncpg rejects an aware value outright.
17. **`ENVIRONMENT=test` is not `development`.** Config guards that relax "in development" must
    list both, or the whole suite fails at import with a validation error.

## 9. Conventions that must not be broken

- No business logic in route handlers — validate and delegate to a service.
- Every external system behind an adapter in `api/adapters/`. No direct SDK calls from modules.
- Async work never runs inline in a request handler.
- No user-facing string hardcoded — `en.json` and `hi.json` updated together.
- Every header/footer link must resolve; unbuilt pages render `PlaceholderPage`, never 404.
- New architectural decisions get a new ADR, not a silent divergence.
- Aadhaar, resumes and assessment results must go through the ADR-023 encryption path — including
  staying out of logs. Resume-derived embeddings inherit the same sensitivity.

## 10. Git state

- Branch **`v2/sprint-1-skeleton`** — name is now misleading, it holds two sprints. Worth renaming.
- **Nothing has been committed.** The whole rebuild is uncommitted working tree.
- The original `app/` (identity module, auth, 8 actor types) was deleted in this branch's working
  tree but **remains in history on `main`** at commit `ef59c4e`. Recoverable if the identity work
  is worth mining when Sprint 3 builds auth.
- `docs/` was carried forward untouched.

## 11. What comes next

**Sprints 3 and 4 are planned in full** — see the plan file listed in §2. Summary:

**Sprint 3 — Marketplace: Jobs & Courses.** New `api/modules/marketplace/` built to the
`skills` module pattern. `Tenant` (in `identity/`, models only), `Job` + `job_skills`
(`importance`, `is_mandatory`), `Course` + `course_skills` (`level_taught`). Ops-seeded via
`scripts/seed_marketplace.py`, ~20 jobs and ~20 courses. No auth. `/jobs` and `/courses` list and
detail pages replace their `PlaceholderPage` stubs, and **`/skills/[slug]` gains "jobs needing this
skill" and "courses teaching this skill"** — the point at which the taxonomy becomes a navigable
graph rather than a glossary.

**Sprint 4 — Identity and the candidate profile.** Phone + OTP for candidates only; org/email login
deferred because orgs have nothing to publish yet. `User` with nullable independently-unique
phone/email, `Membership`, JWT access + rotating refresh in Redis, per-phone OTP rate limiting.
First real occupant of `api/adapters/` — a `NotificationProvider` protocol with a console
implementation that logs the OTP in dev. `CandidateProfile` + `candidate_skills` in the marketplace
module. `/signin` and `/profile` go live; adding skills reuses the existing `SkillBrowser`.

**Sprint 5 is matching** — the payoff, and now unblocked: all three sides of the graph exist.
Two things must land with or before it, and neither exists:
1. **Analytics instrumentation** (`analytics_events`). ADR-025 makes measurement the substitute for
   a revenue signal and nothing currently records anything.
2. **A golden-set evaluation harness** — hand-labelled candidate/job pairs, precision@5 in CI.

Deliberately still unscheduled: the NSQF hierarchy above Skill (SSC → Sector → Occupation → QP →
NOS) and its importer. Acquiring real NSQF data is a project in itself — per-SSC documents, no clean
public API — and remains the single most underestimated line item in the plan.

## 12. Open risks — state these honestly, do not soften

- Two-sided cold start is unsolved; hybrid supply is a bet, not a solution.
- No revenue model, and free may become the permanent default by inertia.
- Multi-sector dilutes GTM focus — a knowing trade, reversible by narrowing GTM only.
- Recommendation quality is **unproven and unmeasured**. Every claim about it is a hypothesis
  until the golden-set harness exists.
- Self-declared skills are unreliable until assessment integration lands.
- Employer-side supply is the weakest link in Indian vocational markets.
